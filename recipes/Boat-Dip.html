            <li>he sour cream and the liquid from the Rotel might split after sitting in the fridge for a while. If this happens, just give it a quick stir to recombine.</li>
            <li>If you have time, chill the dip in the fridge for an hour or so before serving. This will allow the flavors to meld together more.</li>
            <li>Easily double the batch if you're serving a crowd. Just make sure your mixing bowl or container is large enough as it can be hard to mix together otherwise.</li>
